InternNavigatr is an IOS application for Streamlining Internship Applications for students. 

#### Objective:
The objective of this innovative iOS application is to revolutionize the process of searching and applying for internships. This app will provide students with a convenient platform to fetch open internships from the internet based on their desired filters, while also assisting them in organizing their internship applications, tracking important dates, and managing the status of each application (such as interview schedule, application completion, acceptance, or rejection).

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Applications that I like:
1) LinkedIn
   - Minimilistic yet Professional Design for user readability. The plane white background makes it top notch.
   - Different sections in invidual profiles for example: Education, Projects, Work Experience.
   - News Feed and Content Presentation through Intuitive Navigation
   - Job Search with filters and recommendations: "People you may know", "Jobs for your fit"
2) Snapchat
   - The messages automatically disappears if not intentionally saved. Also the attentive bitmoji at the bottom.
   - Fun filters and Lenses to play with. Also, use of bitmoji in texts.
   - Private messaging and group messaging.
   - Creative tools to doodle, comment. Also, tracking geolocation of friends is fun. 
3) Apple Notes
   - Rich Text Formatting with various text styles, font sizes, bold, italics, underline, bullet points, and numbered lists.
   - Media Integration so that user can add videos, photo while also keeping it simple for begineer to use.
   - Organization and searching through notes is made simple.
   - Markup and collaboration makes it easy to interact while giving feedbacks.
